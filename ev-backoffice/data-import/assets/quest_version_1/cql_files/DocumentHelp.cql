                            An adjudication of juvenile delinquency is not a 'conviction' under U.S. immigration law,
                            but a
                            juvenile can be charged as an adult for an offense committed while a juvenile. If you were
                            convicted as an adult, there is a conviction, regardless of whether you were tried before a
                            criminal court or a juvenile court. An adjudication of juvenile delinquency could also be
                            relevant to the exercise of discretion. If you claim that an arrest resulted in adjudication
                            of
                            delinquency, and not in a conviction, you must submit a copy of the court document that
                            establishes this fact.

                    evidence of sufficient income or financial resources may result in the denial of the foreign national's

                            copies of documents showing that any prior marriages were legally terminated (if
                            applicable),

                            adoption, you must submit a copy of the adoption decree showing that the adoption took place
                            before the child turned 16 years of age. If you adopted a child under 16 years of age, and
                            you
                            also adopted the older sibling of that child, you may file a petition for the older child if
                            the
                            adoption occurred before the older child turned 18 years of age. You must submit a copy of
                            the
                            adoption decree showing that the adoption of the sibling occurred before the sibling turned
                            18
                            years of age. In either case, you must also submit copies of evidence that each child was in
                            the
                            legal custody of and resided with the parents who adopted him or her for at least two years
                            before or after adoption. Only a court or recognized government entity may grant legal
                            custody,
                            and it is usually granted at the time the adoption is finalized. However, if legal custody
                            is
                            granted by a court or recognized government entity prior to the adoption, that time may
                            count
                            toward fulfilling the 2-year legal custody requirement.</li>
