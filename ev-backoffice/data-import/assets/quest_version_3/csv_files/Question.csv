The first part is your about qualifying relatives that might experience extreme hardship if you are denied the Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver. The second part is your personal statement explaining why the USCIS should grant you the Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver. These concepts are explained in depth below.
<br/><br/>
Part 1
<br/><br/>
Explain in detail the 'extreme hardship' your spouse and/or parent(s) would experience if you are refused admission to the United States. Your statement must explain why you believe your qualifying relative would experience extreme hardship if you are refused admission to the United States.
<br/><br/>
You may submit any evidence to support your claim that your qualifying relative would experience extreme hardship if you are refused admission to the United States and your U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent must remain in the United States without you or relocate abroad to reside with you outside of the United States. Factors USCIS considers when determining extreme hardship include, but are not limited to:
<br/><br/>
1. Health. Examples include: Ongoing or specialized treatment required for a physical or mental condition, availability or quality of such treatment in the foreign country, anticipated treatment duration, whether the condition is long term, and whether it is chronic or acute;
<br/>
2. Financial considerations. Examples include: Future employability, loss due to sale of home or business or termination of a professional practice, a decline in standard of living, ability to recoup short-term losses, cost of extraordinary needs (such as special education or training for children with special needs), or the cost of care for family members such as elderly or sick parents;
<br/>
3. Education. Examples include: Loss of opportunity for higher education, lower quality or limited scope of education options, disruption of a current program, requirement to be educated in a foreign language or culture with ensuing loss of time or grade, and availability of special requirements, such as training programs or internships in specific fields;
<br/>
4. Personal considerations. Examples include: Close relatives in the United States and country of birth or citizenship, separation from spouse or children, ages of involved parties, and length of residence and community ties in the United States; and
<br/>
5. Special factors. Examples include: Cultural, language-related, religious, and ethnic obstacles; valid fears of persecution, physical harm, or injury; social ostracism or stigma; and lack of access to social institutions or structures (official or unofficial) that provide support, guidance, or protection.
<br/><br/>
Part 2
<br/><br/>
Your statement must also explain why you believe USCIS should approve your waiver application as a matter of discretion. Approval of a provisional unlawful presence waiver is discretionary, and the USCIS officer will weigh favorable and unfavorable factors presented in your case to determine whether he or she should approve your request. You should explain why you believe USCIS should approve your application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver because of the favorable factors, and why the unfavorable factors should not carry as much weight as the favorable ones.
<br/><br/>
Approval of Form I-601A is discretionary. To determine if your case warrants a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS will review the evidence in the records and weigh all favorable and unfavorable factors when deciding whether to approve your application as a matter of discretion. You should describe the favorable and unfavorable factors in your case and explain why you think the favorable factors should be given more weight.
<br/>
Some favorable factors may include, but are not limited to:
<br/>
1. Close family ties in the United States;
<br/>
2. Hardship to your relatives who are U.S. citizens or LPRs, or to yourself, or your employer in the United States;
<br/>
3. Evidence of reformation and rehabilitation;
<br/>
4. Length of lawful presence in the United States and your immigration status while you were lawfully present;
<br/>
5. Evidence of respect for law and order, good moral character, and family responsibilities or intent to hold family responsibilities;
<br/>
6. Absence of significant undesirable or negative factors; and
<br/>
7. Likelihood that you will become an LPR in the near future.
<br/><br/>
Some unfavorable factors may include, but are not limited to:
<br/>
1. Evidence of bad moral character, including criminal tendencies reflected by past convictions or an ongoing unlawful activity or continuing police record;
<br/>
2. Repeated violations of U.S. immigration laws and a willful disregard for other laws;
<br/>
3. Absence of close family ties or hardships;
<br/>
4. Fraudulent marriage to a U.S. citizen for the purpose"
